# London Tube Crowding Analysis

## Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to my London Tube Crowding Analysis project. This is a coursework done for one of the module at the Department of Informatics. The goal of this project was to create a dynamic webpage that displays the crowding levels at different London Underground (tube) stations on different weekdays. HTML, JSON, JavaScript, and AJAX were used to achieve this.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your computer using 
```
git clone https://github.com/XEZ1/LondonCrowding.git
```
2. Open the HTML file in your preferred web browser.
3. Choose a tube station and a day of the week from the drop-down lists.
4. Click the "View Crowding Info" button to see the results.

## Features

- Choose a tube station and day of the week.
- Retrieve crowding information from the Transport for London (TfL) API.
- Display a bar chart using Chart.js to visualize crowding percentages.
- Show AM and PM peak time frames.
- Display a table with detailed crowding information in 15-minute increments.

## Technology Stack

- HTML: Creating the webpage structure.
- JavaScript: Handling user interactions and API requests.
- Chart.js: Generating dynamic bar charts.
- AJAX: Asynchronous API requests.
- jQuery: Simplifying DOM manipulation.
- TfL API: Retrieving crowding data for selected stations and days.
